clojurescript fun

# TODO
- ring-swagger support
- schema support for validation
- deploy to Heroku
- Clojurescript page with OM/React/Reagent?
- multi user authentication
- find graphics
- use an agent or some coordinated refs to change all the mutable state in an atomic way

# Other ideas

- use core.async
- use core.logic to auto-solve via unification?
